# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I have started righting the doc strings as I go instead of coming back and doing them at the end.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I need to re-read the questions once im done to ensure I don't make simple mistakes.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

Getting the videos, practicals and quizzes done early and not right before the due date.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to mix up my comments more as I find myself starting with Add alot 

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I wouldn't mind a deliverables section for each task such as a dot pointed list which would make checking if you left something out easier.
