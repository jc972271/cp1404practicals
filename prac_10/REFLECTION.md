# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

Mostly accurate within 5 minutes except for the project management task in prac 7 where I undershot the estimate by an
hour and a half.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

Overall I would say my estimate's accuracy stayed consistent, however my method for estimating the time changed. During
the first attempts at estimation, I mostly guessed relying on my instincts and prior experiences to get to the answer.
However, as I progress further into the subject my estimations came from me reading the task breaking it up into parts
then estimating the time for those sections. I then added these estimates together to get the expected time.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

Overall, I did not learn much from estimating how much time a project would take. However, it did teach me how to break
a problem into smaller steps. I then approached the problems a single step at a time helping me understand the issue and
debug my code.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I learnt that while I exceed of programming the functionality of the task my formating still needs work.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

The main thing I learnt is that when someone's code is neat it is easy to spot the little flaws that if removed could
make the program better. However, when someone's code is messy and inefficient you only see the big flaws and the small
ones slip under the radar.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
practicals. For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[https://github.com/Winminoo4444/cp1404practicals/pull/2]()

### Explanation

What I did well in this review is when something was not following the guidelines I just simply pointed them out and
what the correction should be. However, when I saw things that could be improved I made suggestions, pointing how the
person could change them.

### Good Code Review 2

[https://github.com/hamzah-opal-n/cp1404practicals/pull/6]()

### Explanation

What I did well in this review was point out something that could be changed throughout the report. However, instead of
a single message I went though and showed which parts this change could apply to.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

Honestly, I would not change anything significant. However, there are some small things I would change. I would make the
review list link more obvious as it is currently hidden as hyperlinked text as part of a sentence. Either by separating
this link from that text or adding it to learn JCU or both. The other small change would be to separate the people who
don't mention others or review other into a separate list.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

What I did well for the practicals was completing them or near completing before the due date. This meant I had time to
correct things if the code did not function. Furthermore, the other thing I did well was reading every question and not
just focussing on what we needed to submit.
